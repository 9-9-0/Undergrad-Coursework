# Project Objectives
- Create a program to prompt the user to guess 5 number (randomized or set) solutions
- After each guess (except the initial guess) provide the user with a hint
- Hint: Print "colder" if user's guess is farther from a solution than the previous guess, "hotter" if closer
- Continue prompting guess until a correct solution is guessed

### Concepts Utilized
- Global Variables
- [Reviewed] Value comparisons
- [Reviewed] Function inputs and calls

### Known Issues
- Risky use of non-constant global variables (can be dismissed due to the scope of this project) 
- Initialized solutions are not randomized (implement rand() or alternative function)
