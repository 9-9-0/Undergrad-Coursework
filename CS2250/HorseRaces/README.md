# Horse Races

### Project Objectives
- Prompt the user to enter in a number of horses in the race, their names and jockeys' names, and 
  the race distance
- Initialize the speed of each horse to a random number
- Begin the race and output the progress of each second in ASCII
- Let user decide if the race is to be continued after each progress output
- Continue races until one of the horses wins
- Keep a tally of the races won by each horse along with the total races run
- Let user decide if another race is to be run

### Concepts Utilized
- Class Object usage
- Dynamic Allocation of Classes
- ASCII Manipulation

### Known Issues
- None

### Further Implementations
- Temporary speed boosts
- Decrease speeds as more races are run, randomly assign bursts of acceleration near finish line to some horses
- Try-Catch blocks for error testing
