# Trie

### Project Objectives
- Create a tree structure, 'Trie', with each of its nodes containing a word, the word's 
  definition, and an array of 26 pointers (one for each letter in the alphabet) to the next node
- Allow the user to input a text file of words and their definitions, each word followed by ':' and
  its definition, each word on a new line. **See sample.txt**
- Input the words into the Trie, each subsequent letter being a child of the previous letter. See Trie.png
- Allow the user to lookup words and output the entire Trie if desired via pre-order transversal
