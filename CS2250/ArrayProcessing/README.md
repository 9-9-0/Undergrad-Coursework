# Array Processing

### Project Objectives
- Create an array (Original Array) of integers in ascending order, starting 
  from zero, based on user's desired size
- Shuffle the created array with a linear swapping algorithm (Shuffled Array)
- Partition the elements of this array into two new arrays;
  Odd Array: all odd integer elements, Even Array: all even integer elements
- Compare each element of #1 with its corresponding element in #2
- Store the greatest of each pair of elements into a final array (ArrayWar Winners)
  and sort these arrays in ascending order (Sorted ArrayWar Winners)
- At each step, output each element of each array. 

### Concepts Utilized
- Dynamic Allocation

### Known Issues
- Non-Const integer used to allocated array (Line 42)
