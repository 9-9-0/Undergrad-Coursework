Usage Instructions:
  1. Run 'make' within the Proj0 directory.
  2. The executable will output within the bin/ subdirectory.
  3. Run 'bin/P0 ...' within the Proj0 directory with your desired arguments (integers or a single input file).
  4. .out files will be output within the Proj0 directory.
  5. Run 'make clean' to clean up object, binary, and .out files.

Caveats:
  I've followed the programming standards to the best of my ability, however I don't think modularizing the main function
  would do the program much good as the inputs for this project are probably not extendible nor generalizable enough to 
  warrant modularization for subsequent projects.
